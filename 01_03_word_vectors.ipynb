For this reason, it is important to convert a word into a number.\n",

These words are then stored in a dictionary that would look like this: {“the”: 1, “a”, 2} etc. This is known as a bag of words. This approach to representing words numerically, however, only allow a computer to understand words numerically to identify unique words.

The number 6 could represent “hates” as much as it could represent “likes”. This is where word vectors come in.\n",

This allows for the the computer to determine the syntactical similarity of words numerically. It then needs to represent these relationships numerically.
